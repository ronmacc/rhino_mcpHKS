SIMPLE SOLUTION
========================================

Your setup is correct. The problem is likely that Claude Desktop 
isn't reading the config or doesn't support MCP.

TRY THIS:

1. Open Claude Desktop Settings
2. Look for "Developer" or "MCP" section
3. Check if "rhino" server is listed
4. If you see an error, that's the problem

IF THAT DOESN'T WORK:

Use Cursor IDE instead - it definitely supports MCP:

1. Install Cursor IDE
2. Create file: %USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json
3. Add this:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rhino": {
      "command": "C:/Users/aroncal/.conda/envs/rhino_mcp/python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "rhino_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
4. Restart Cursor
5. It will work!
