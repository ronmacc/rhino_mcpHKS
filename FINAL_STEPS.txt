GET IT WORKING - FINAL STEPS
========================================

Everything is set up correctly! Just do these 3 things:

1. START RHINO:
   - Open Rhino 7
   - Tools → Python Script → Run...
   - Select: C:\Users\aroncal\Repos\rhino_mcpHKS\rhino_mcp\rhino_mcp_client.py
   - You should see: "RhinoMCP script loaded. Server started automatically."
   - KEEP RHINO OPEN

2. RESTART CLAUDE DESKTOP:
   - Close Claude Desktop completely (quit it)
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Open Claude Desktop again
   - WAIT 20 SECONDS (it needs time to connect)
   - Start a new chat

3. TEST IT:
   - Type: "Get information about the current Rhino scene"
   - If you see more than 3 buttons, IT'S WORKING!

========================================
THAT'S IT! No terminal needed.
========================================

If it still doesn't work, the problem is Claude Desktop not restarting.
Make sure you QUIT it completely, not just close the window.
